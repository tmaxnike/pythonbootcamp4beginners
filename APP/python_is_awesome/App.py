#Simple Interest= P X T X R
#Where P is the principal amount, 
#R is the rate of the interset,
#and the T is the total time of interest on the amount


# Simple interest in python
# Enter the amount
Principal = 1000
# Enter the number of years
Year = 12
# Enter the rate of interest
Rate = 1.2
# Calculate the simple interest
SI = Principal*Year*Rate
print("The simple interest is:", SI)
